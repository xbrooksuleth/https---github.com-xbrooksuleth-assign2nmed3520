<h1 class="intro">Intro to Competitive Pokemon</h1>
<h3 class="intro intro-body">If you're a dedicated trainer, you've probably battled the Elite Four so many times they seem like a chore. You endured this for the sake of training your loyal Pokemon, 
  and after turning them into the fullest they could be, maybe you wanted more. So you decided to battle your friends on Wi-Fi, but after pounding them mercilessly, 
  maybe Pokemon began to get stale. But there is more to this game. Something bigger.</h3>
